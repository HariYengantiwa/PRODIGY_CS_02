Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
Image Encryptor — Simple Pixel-Manipulation Image Encryption Tool

A small, easy-to-understand image encryption tool that uses pixel-level operations (swap / XOR-style keystream) to encrypt and decrypt images. Built for learning, demo, or basic privacy use-cases — not for production cryptographic security.

This repository contains:

image_encryptor.py — a simple CLI to encrypt and decrypt images (PNG / JPEG / BMP supported via Pillow).

README.md — (this file) usage & explanation.

examples/ — optional sample images and CLI examples (you can add).
